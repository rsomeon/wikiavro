But yeah, about me… I'm a complete geek. I spend all the time I can on my computer, write software for fun, am strongly opinionated about free and proprietary software, I think that Windows completely sucks, I listen to bands no one has ever heard of, [[Wikipedia:User:Linus M.|I edit Wikipedia compulsively]], I run [[mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] locally, I figured out how to delete MediaWiki accounts from the MySQL database, and told the Founder how to do this, I can quote Marvin the Paranoid Android verbatim, I was on the old version of RationalWiki, I created an account on the new version before the Main Page had even been modified, I designed the old logo, etc.

So yeah, I'm completely cool.</text>

I'm a Christian - but don't confuse &quot;Christian&quot; with &quot;ultraconservative&quot;, or YEC, or even OEC. I believe in both the Big Bang and evolution, although I believe that God had a hand in both, to some extent, and by that I mean that I don't believe that God necessarily guided them over every step of the way. I'm also of partial Jewish decent, so if you insult me, I reserve the right to call you an anti-semite ;).

As far as politics goes, I tend towards libertarianism - you can do whatever you want, and it doesn't really bother me (although I might not condone it), as long as you're not harming anyone else. I also tend towards communism, ideally, but, sadly, communism doesn't work.

First new account! W00t!

But yeah, about me… I'm a complete geek. I spend all the time I can on my computer, write software for fun, am strongly opinionated about free and proprietary software, I think that Windows completely sucks, I listen to bands no one has ever heard of, [[Wikipedia:User:Linus M.|I edit Wikipedia compulsively]], I run [[mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] locally, I figured out how to delete MediaWiki accounts from the MySQL database, and told the Founder how to do this, I can quote Marvin the Paranoid Android verbatim, I was on the old version of RationalWiki, I created an account on the new version before the Main Page had even been modified, I designed the logo, etc.

So yeah, I'm completely cool.

Oh, I forgot. I'm also apparently a cybercriminal, who's being investigated by the FBI. So I've been told. However, I doubt this assessment's veracity (in case you were looking in horror at your monitor).

I'm a Christian - but don't confuse &quot;Christian&quot; with &quot;ultraconservative&quot;, or YEC, or even OEC. I believe in both the Big Bang and evolution, although I believe that God had a hand in both, to some extent, and by that I mean that I don't believe that God necessarily guided them over every step of the way. I'm also of partial Jewish decent, so if you insult me, I reserve the right to call you an anti-semite ;).

As far as politics goes, I tend towards libertarianism - you can do whatever you want, and it doesn't really bother me (although I might not condone it), as long as you're not harming anyone else who hasn't fully consciously consented to whatever it is that is harmful. I also tend towards communism, ideally, but, sadly, communism doesn't work.

And I'm both a [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Bureaucrat|bureaucrat]] and [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Sysop|sysop]] on Rationalwiki, and the semi-official tech guy, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.</text>

First new account! W00t!

But yeah, about me… I'm a complete geek. I spend all the time I can on my computer, write software for fun, am strongly opinionated about free and proprietary software, I think that Windows completely sucks, I listen to bands no one has ever heard of, [[Wikipedia:User:Linus M.|I edit Wikipedia compulsively]], I run [[mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] locally, I figured out how to delete MediaWiki accounts from the MySQL database, and told the Founder how to do this, I can quote Marvin the Paranoid Android verbatim, I was on the old version of RationalWiki, I created an account on the new version before the Main Page had even been modified, I designed the logo, etc.

So yeah, I'm completely cool.

Oh, I forgot. I'm also apparently a cybercriminal, who's being investigated by the FBI. So I've been told. However, I doubt this assessment's veracity (in case you were looking in horror at your monitor).

I'm a Christian - but don't confuse &quot;Christian&quot; with &quot;ultraconservative&quot;, or YEC, or even OEC. I believe in both the Big Bang and evolution, although I believe that God had a hand in both, to some extent, and by that I mean that I don't believe that God necessarily guided them over every step of the way. I'm also of partial Jewish decent, so if you insult me, I reserve the right to call you an anti-semite ;).

As far as politics goes, I tend towards libertarianism - you can do whatever you want, and it doesn't really bother me (although I might not condone it), as long as you're not harming anyone else who hasn't fully consciously consented to whatever it is that is harmful. I also tend towards communism, ideally, but, sadly, communism doesn't work.

And I'm both a [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Bureaucrat|bureaucrat]] and [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Sysop|sysop]] on Rationalwiki, and the semi-official tech guy, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

First new account! W00t!

But yeah, about me… I'm a complete geek. I spend all the time I can on my computer, write software for fun, am strongly opinionated about free and proprietary software, I think that Windows completely sucks, I listen to bands no one has ever heard of, [[Wikipedia:User:Linus M.|I edit Wikipedia compulsively]], I run [[mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] locally, I figured out how to delete MediaWiki accounts from the MySQL database, and told the Founder how to do this, I can quote Marvin the Paranoid Android verbatim, I was on the old version of RationalWiki, I created an account on the new version before the Main Page had even been modified, I designed the logo, etc.

So yeah, I'm completely cool.

Oh, I forgot. I'm also apparently a cybercriminal, who's being investigated by the FBI. So I've been told. However, I doubt this assessment's veracity (in case you were looking in horror at your monitor).

I'm a Christian - but don't confuse &quot;Christian&quot; with &quot;ultraconservative&quot;, or YEC, or even OEC. I believe in both the Big Bang and evolution, although I believe that God had a hand in both, to some extent, and by that I mean that I don't believe that God necessarily guided them over every step of the way. I'm also of partial Jewish decent, so if you insult me, I reserve the right to call you an anti-semite ;).

As far as politics goes, I tend towards libertarianism - you can do whatever you want, and it doesn't really bother me (although I might not condone it), as long as you're not harming anyone else who hasn't fully consciously consented to whatever it is that is harmful. I also tend towards socialism, ideally, but, sadly, socialism doesn't work.

And I'm both a [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Bureaucrat|bureaucrat]] and [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Sysop|sysop]] on Rationalwiki, and the semi-official tech guy, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

First new account! W00t!

But yeah, about me… I'm a complete geek. I spend all the time I can on my computer, write software for fun, am strongly opinionated about free and proprietary software, I think that Windows completely sucks, I listen to bands no one has ever heard of, [[Wikipedia:User:Linus M.|I edit Wikipedia compulsively]], I run [[mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] locally, I figured out how to delete MediaWiki accounts from the MySQL database, and told the Founder how to do this, I can quote Marvin the Paranoid Android verbatim, I was on the old version of RationalWiki, I created an account on the new version before the Main Page had even been modified, I designed the logo, etc.

So yeah, I'm completely cool.

Oh, I forgot. I'm also apparently a cybercriminal, who's being investigated by the FBI. So I've been told. However, I doubt this assessment's veracity (in case you were looking in horror at your monitor).

I'm a Christian - but don't confuse &quot;Christian&quot; with &quot;ultraconservative&quot;, or YEC, or even OEC. I believe in both the Big Bang and evolution, although I believe that God had a hand in both, to some extent, and by that I mean that I don't believe that God necessarily guided them over every step of the way. I'm also of partial Jewish decent, so if you insult me, I reserve the right to call you an anti-semite ;).

As far as politics goes, I tend towards libertarianism - you can do whatever you want, and it doesn't really bother me (although I might not condone it), as long as you're not harming anyone else who hasn't fully consciously consented to whatever it is that is harmful. I also tend towards socialism, ideally, but, sadly, socialism doesn't work.

And I'm both a [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Bureaucrat|bureaucrat]] and [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Sysop|sysop]] on Rationalwiki, and the semi-official tech guy, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

First new account! W00t!

But yeah, about me… I'm a complete geek. I spend all the time I can on my computer, write software for fun, am strongly opinionated about free and proprietary software, I think that Windows completely sucks, I listen to bands no one has ever heard of, [[Wikipedia:User:Linus M.|I edit Wikipedia compulsively]], I run [[mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] locally, I figured out how to delete MediaWiki accounts from the MySQL database, and told the Founder how to do this, I can quote Marvin the Paranoid Android verbatim, I was on the old version of RationalWiki, I created an account on the new version before the Main Page had even been modified, I designed the logo, etc.

So yeah, I'm completely cool.

Oh, I forgot. I'm also apparently a cybercriminal, who's being investigated by the FBI. So I've been told. However, I doubt this assessment's veracity (in case you were looking in horror at your monitor).

I'm a Christian - but don't confuse &quot;Christian&quot; with &quot;ultraconservative&quot;, or YEC, or even OEC. I believe in both the Big Bang and evolution, although I believe that God had a hand in both, to some extent, and by that I mean that I don't believe that God necessarily guided them over every step of the way. I'm also of partial Jewish decent, so if you insult me, I reserve the right to call you an anti-semite ;).

As far as politics goes, I tend towards [[libertarianism]] - you can do whatever you want, and it doesn't really bother me (although I might not condone it), as long as you're not harming anyone else who hasn't fully consciously consented to whatever it is that is harmful. I also tend towards socialism, ideally, but, sadly, socialism doesn't work.

And I'm both a [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Bureaucrat|bureaucrat]] and [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Sysop|sysop]] on Rationalwiki, and the semi-official tech guy, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

First new account! W00t!

But yeah, about me… I'm a complete geek. I spend all the time I can on my computer, write software for fun, am strongly opinionated about free and proprietary software, I think that Windows completely sucks, I listen to bands no one has ever heard of, [[Wikipedia:User:Linus M.|I edit Wikipedia compulsively]], I run [[mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] locally, I figured out how to delete MediaWiki accounts from the MySQL database, and told the Founder how to do this, I can quote Marvin the Paranoid Android verbatim, I was on the old version of RationalWiki, I created an account on the new version before the Main Page had even been modified, I designed the logo, etc.

So yeah, I'm completely cool.

Oh, I forgot. I'm also apparently a cybercriminal, who's being investigated by the FBI. So I've been told. However, I doubt this assessment's veracity (in case you were looking in horror at your monitor).

I'm a Christian - but don't confuse &quot;Christian&quot; with &quot;ultraconservative&quot;, or YEC, or even OEC. I believe in both the Big Bang and evolution, although I believe that God had a hand in both, to some extent, and by that I mean that I don't believe that God necessarily guided them over every step of the way. I'm also of partial Jewish decent, so if you insult me, I reserve the right to call you an anti-semite ;).

As far as politics goes, I tend towards [[libertarianism]] - you can do whatever you want, and it doesn't really bother me (although I might not condone it), as long as you're not harming anyone else who hasn't fully consciously consented to whatever it is that is harmful. I also tend towards socialism, ideally, but, sadly, socialism doesn't work.

And I'm both a [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Bureaucrat|bureaucrat]] and [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Sysop|sysop]] on Rationalwiki, and the semi-official tech guy, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.
